                <p>The District can claim to have played a significant part in fostering the trade relations between Kerala and the outside world in the ancient and medieval period. It can also claim to have played an important part in fostering cultural relations and in laying the foundation of a cosmopolitan and compose culture in this part of the country. Kodungalloor which had the unique distinction of being the “Primum Emporium India”, also belongs to the signal honour of having first given shelter to all the three communities which have contributed to the prosperity of Malabar’. These three communities are the Christians, the Jews and the Muslims.</p><p>In 1790 Raja Rama Varma (1790-1805) popularly known as Saktan Tampuran ascended the throne of Cochin. With the accession of this ruler the English or modern period in the history of Cochin and of the District began. It may be noted in this connection that Saktan Tampuram had been at the helm of affairs since 1769 when all administrative authority in the state was delegated to him by the then reigning sovereign on the initiative of the Travancore Raja and the Dutch Governor. As his very name suggests, this prince was a strong ruler and his reign was characterized by firm and vigorous administration. We have seen that by the end of the 18th century the power of the feudal chieftains had been crushed and royal authority had become supreme.Saktan Tampuran was mainly responsible for the destruction of the power of the feudal chieftains and increase of royal power. Another potent force in the public life of Trichur and its suburbs was the Namboodithiri community. A large part of the Trichur Taluk was for long under the domination of the Yogiatiripppads, the ecclesiastical h4eads of the Vadakkunnathan and Perumanam Devaswoms. The Yogiatirippads were elected and consecrated by the Namboodithiri Yogams of the respective places. Under their leadership the Namboodithiri families of Trichur and Perumanam were playing in active part against the ruler of Cochin in his wars against the Zamorin of Calicut. Hence after the expulsion of the Zamorin from Trichur in 1761 drastic action was taken against these families by the Raja of Cochin. The institution of Yogiatirippads was discontinued and the management of Trichur and Perumanam Devaswoms was taken over by the Government. The Namboothiri Yogams were reduced to impotence. Thus the antifeudal measures of Saktan Tampuran coupled with the several administrative reforms introduced by him marked the end of the medieval period in the history of Cochin and ushered in the modern epoch of progress.It may be interesting in this connection to know something about the institution of the Yogatirippad. The Yogiatirippad of the Vadakkunnathan Devaswom was elected by the Namboothiri illams of Trichur and its suburbs The Yogiatirippad was elected for life in the august presence of the ruler of Cochin, local chieftains and prominent Namboothiris from places outside Trichur. An interesting account of the Yogiatiri Avarodham (ceremony connected with the consecration of the Yogiatirippad) as gathered from the Grandhavari or chronicles of the Trichur temple is given by K.P. Padmanabha Menon in his History of Kerala Vol IV (p.82086). The Yogiatirippad was a very powerful and influential dignitary. The last Yogiatirippad was banished from Trichur 1763 for having joined the side of the Zamorin against Cochin. Saktan Tampuran put an end to the institution of the Yogiatirippad. Since then the numerous Namboodiri illams situated in Trichur gradually became extinct. But even today there are a few Namboothiri illams in Trichur town and its suburbs reminding one of those old days when the Namboothiri Yogam of Trichur along with the Perumanam Yogam exercised jurisdiction over a large portion of the present Trichur Taluk.</p><a href="www.keralatourism.org">For More</a></p>
